<p>Computer Science and Engineering offers 4-year B.E. and 2 year M.E. programme in Computer Science and Engineering. The branch has recently started with new M.E programme in CSE with Cyber Security as specialized area. The branch also offers Doctoral programme under the Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh. The branch puts strong emphasis on building core fundamentals for the undergraduates and post graduates. We provide an in-depth education in engineering principles built on mathematics, computation, and CS concepts and encourage students to apply what they had learnt through projects, internships, and research. We offer excellent teaching learning process, better alumni relations and industry alliance through research projects and consultancies. We provide strong exposure to cutting edge and emerging technologies like Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Informatics and Cyber Security, Cloud computing, Medical imaging and devices, Computer Networking to name a few. Graduates of Computer science and Engineering branch work in diverse industries and conduct research in a broad range of areas. We had strong faculty base in research in the areas of Computer Networks, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Deep learning and parallel processing. A number of sponsored research projects have been offered by various International and National Funding agencies to our faculties.</p>
