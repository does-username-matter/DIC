<h1><strong><u>Mechanical Engineering</u></strong></h1>
<br>

<p>A programme designed to ossify students’ concepts, the 8 semester course teaches students the basis of our mechanical studies as well as the latest operation management, research and analysis techniques practised in the industries.

The latest curriculum and mechanical design softwares to facilitate efficiency, research and to be in sync with the industry.
Faculty involved in the latest researches in the engineering world.
Top 4% students from all over India, today with sound technical base, equipped with operational knowledge in design softwares and an extensive industrial experience.</p>

<p>One of the key focuses of mechanical engineering is the design and manufacturing of machines and mechanical systems. Mechanical engineers work on the development of automobiles, aircraft, machinery, and other mechanical devices. They apply principles of mechanics and materials science to design components, optimize performance, and ensure the safety and reliability of mechanical systems.

Another important aspect of mechanical engineering is energy systems. Mechanical engineers work on the design and optimization of energy conversion systems, such as engines, turbines, and renewable energy technologies. They play a crucial role in developing sustainable solutions for power generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency.

Mechanical engineers also work in the field of robotics and automation, where they design and develop robotic systems and automated manufacturing processes. They contribute to advancements in industries such as automotive manufacturing, aerospace, and healthcare, enhancing productivity and precision.</p>
