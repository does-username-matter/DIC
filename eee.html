<h1><strong><u>Electrical & Electronics Engineering</u></strong></h1>
<br>

<p>The program in Electrical & Electronics Engineering is a multidisciplinary course that aims to train engineers in the field of Core Electrical Engineering along with Electronics Engineering & Computer Sciences. The focus of the Electrical & Electronics Department is on three major areas-power & Energy, Machines to neural networks and database management systems.

The Department is well equipped and has lab facilities: Electric machinery Lab. Power Systems Lab. Linear Circuit Analysis Lab. Control Engineering. Microcontroller & PLC lab.</p>
<p>One of the key focuses of EEE is power systems, where engineers design, maintain, and manage the generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical power. They work on power grids, substations, and renewable energy systems to ensure a reliable and sustainable supply of electricity.

In the realm of electronics, EEE engineers design and develop electronic devices, such as integrated circuits, microcontrollers, and sensors. They work on digital systems, telecommunications networks, and embedded systems, contributing to advancements in areas like telecommunications, computing, and automation.

Additionally, EEE engineers play a crucial role in the development of renewable energy technologies. They work on solar power systems, wind energy systems, and energy storage solutions to harness and optimize renewable energy sources, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impact on the environment.</p>
