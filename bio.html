<h1><strong><u>Biotechnology</u></strong></h1>
<br>

<p>Biotechnology department aims to promote academic and research programme in biotechnology through upto-date curricula for developing trained manpower in its various branches. The labs are equipped with the following instruments: Ultra-pure water purification system, Refrigerated Incubator Shaker, Autoclaves Cold centrifuge, Sonicator, Bioreactor Precision Balance, Orbital shaker, Laminar Air Flow, Micro-centrifuge Refrigerated (Table top portable type), CO2 Incubator, Laminar air Flow, Inverted Microscope PCR Machine, Elisa Reader, Gel Documentation System, UV Transilluminator, Electroporator, HPLC, Refrigerated Incubator Shaker, -200C Freezer, Continuous stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), Plug Flow Reactor, Batch Reactor, Residence Time Distribution Studies (RTD), Studies in CSTR etc.</p>


<p>One of the primary focuses of biotechnology engineering is healthcare and medical applications. Biotechnology engineers work on the development of new drugs, vaccines, and therapies by leveraging biotechnological techniques. They conduct research on genetic engineering, tissue engineering, and bioinformatics to advance medical treatments and diagnostic methods. Biotechnology also plays a crucial role in the production of biopharmaceuticals, such as insulin and antibodies, through the use of recombinant DNA technology.

In the agricultural sector, biotechnology engineers contribute to crop improvement and plant biotechnology. They develop genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that possess desired traits, such as disease resistance, increased yield, and enhanced nutritional value. Biotechnology is also employed in the development of sustainable agricultural practices, including biopesticides and biofertilizers.
